- Handling missing variables; On gender Column, undisclosed gender was replaced by a generic gender status 'No gender'.
- Data Cleaning and formatting; On Salary and Department columns, Employees with no salary and department were taken out.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:

1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments?
 - Gender Distribution:
   
    i. Male: 465
   
    ii. Female: 441
   
    iii. No gender: 40

- Regions/Locations: Total employee in each location
  
    i. Kaduna: 361
   
    ii. Abuja: 335

    iii. Lagos: 250

- Departments: Total employee in each department
  
   
    i. Product Management: 89

    ii. Human Resource: 82
  
    iii. Services: 82

    iv. Support: 81

2. Show insights on ratings based on gender:
   
    -Male: 49%
   
    -Female: 46%
   
    -No gender: 4%
    
      
4. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management:
Based on the value distribution of the salary column there is no gender pay gap, employees are payed based on assigned roles and not gender.

4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000. Does Palmoria meet this requirement? No, it does not meet the requirement because some of the employees received below $90,000.

5. Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:

6. How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,
etc.?

 This was also visualized by regions
