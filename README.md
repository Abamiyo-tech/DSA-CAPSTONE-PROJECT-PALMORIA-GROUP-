## Data Cleaning and Preparation:
In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed. 
- Data loading and inspection; The company's data was uploaded and inspected to transform
- Handling missing variables; On gender Column, undisclosed gender was replaced by a generic gender status 'No gender'.
- Data Cleaning and formatting; Employees without salaries and departments indicated as "NULL" were taken out.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments?
### Gender Distribution Analysis:
(a.) Create a bar chart:
 - Axis: Location by Department
   
    i. Kaduna: 361
   
    ii. Abuja: 335

    iii. Lagos: 250

- Value: Count of Employees by Gender
     
    i. Male: 465
   
    ii. Female: 441
   
    iii. No gender: 40

(b.) Use a slicer to filter by region/department

- Regions/Departments: (No gender, Male, Female)
  
   i. Product Management: 89 (No gender-1, Male-47, Female-41)

   ii. Human Resource: 82 (No gender-3, Male-38, Female-41)
  
   iii. Services: 82 (No gender-3, Male-37, Female-42)
  
   iv. Support: 81 (No gender-4, Male-42, Female-35)
  
   v. Business Development: 81 (No gender-3, Male-37, Female-41)
    
   vi. Sales: 80 (No gender-4, Male-40, Female-36)
  
   vii. Engineering: 80 (No gender-6, Male-36, Female-38)
  
   viii. Training: 77 (No gender-3, Male-38, Female-36)
  
   ix. Research and Development: 74 (No gender-5, Male-31, Female-38)
  
   x. Accounting: 67 (No gender-2, Male-37, Female-28)
  
   xi. Marketing: 65 (No gender-1, Male-33, Female-31)
    
   xii. Legal: 88 (No gender-5, Male-34, Female-49)
  
  

2. Show insights on ratings based on gender:
   
    -Male: 49%
   
    -Female: 46%
   
    -No gender: 4%
    
      
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management:
Based on the value distribution of the salary column there is no gender pay gap, employees are payed based on assigned roles and not gender.

4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000. Does Palmoria meet this requirement? No, it does not meet the requirement because some of the employees received below $90,000.

5. Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:

6. How many employees fall into a band of
   - $10,000 – $20,000,none
   - $20,000 – $30,000,none

 This was also visualized by regions

 Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
● Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
● Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide
